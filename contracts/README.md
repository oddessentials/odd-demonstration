# Distributed Task Observatory

The **Distributed Task Observatory** is a self-contained, local-first demonstration platform that shows how modern, production-grade distributed systems are built, operated, and understood. At its core, it allows users to submit small “jobs” that flow through a polyglot, event-driven microservice architecture running on Kubernetes. Each job moves through a clear lifecycle—creation, dispatch, execution, success or failure—while emitting structured events, metrics, and alerts that make the system’s behavior fully visible end-to-end.

What makes the application compelling is that the _task itself is deliberately simple_; the value is in everything around it. The platform showcases a complete observability pipeline—metrics scraped by Prometheus, alerts routed through Alertmanager, and rich dashboards in Grafana—alongside durable storage in PostgreSQL and NoSQL, asynchronous coordination via a message bus, and a unified read-model consumed by both a Rust-based terminal UI and a web mirror. Every component is built, deployed, and orchestrated using Bazel, kind, and Kubernetes, with strict contracts ensuring that independently developed services interoperate deterministically.

Someone should be interested in the Distributed Task Observatory because it makes the invisible visible. It is not a toy microservices demo, but a realistic, inspectable reference system that shows how contracts, observability, and platform discipline enable teams to scale complexity without losing control. It is equally useful as a learning tool, an architectural reference, and a foundation for experimenting with reliability, failure modes, and operational excellence in a modern distributed stack.
