---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get the Distributed Task Observatory running locally with the fewest possible steps.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oddessentials/odd-demonstration.git
cd odd-demonstration
```

### 2️⃣ Install the dashboard CLI

Choose **one** option:

**Binary (recommended):**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oddessentials/odd-demonstration/main/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oddessentials/odd-demonstration/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**npm:**

```bash
npm install -g @oddessentials/odd-dashboard
```

### 3️⃣ Verify prerequisites

```bash
odd-dashboard doctor
```

This checks for Docker Desktop, PowerShell, kubectl, and kind, and tells you exactly what’s missing if anything isn’t installed.

### 4️⃣ Start Docker Desktop

Ensure Docker Desktop is running before continuing.

### 5️⃣ Launch the system

```bash
odd-dashboard
```

That’s it. The TUI will guide you the rest of the way.

➡️ **Next:** Press **L** in the TUI to launch the local cluster.

**What the TUI does:**

1. ✅ Checks Docker, PowerShell, kubectl, and kind
2. 📋 Shows missing tools with install commands
3. 📎 Press **C** to copy a command to your clipboard
4. 🚀 Press **L** to launch the cluster

> 💡 Rust is only required when building the TUI from source.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Guide

This section is for contributors or anyone running the system directly from source.

### Option 1: Rust TUI Launcher (Recommended for dev)

```bash
cd src/interfaces/tui
cargo run --release
```

---

### Option 2: One-shot startup script

Use this if all prerequisites are already installed.

```bash
# Windows
.\scripts\start-all.ps1

# macOS / Linux
pwsh ./scripts/start-all.ps1
```

---

### 🐳 Docker Hub Images

Pre-built container images are published to Docker Hub for faster integration testing and CI reproducibility.

[View on docker hub here](https://hub.docker.com/u/oddessentials)

#### Available Images

| Image                                      | Base             | Size    | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `oddessentials/odto-gateway:latest`        | node:20-slim     | ~320 MB | API Gateway (Node.js/TypeScript) |
| `oddessentials/odto-processor:latest`      | python:3.11-slim | ~490 MB | Job Processor (Python)           |
| `oddessentials/odto-metrics-engine:latest` | distroless       | ~23 MB  | Metrics Aggregator (Go)          |
| `oddessentials/odto-read-model:latest`     | distroless       | ~20 MB  | Query API (Go)                   |
| `oddessentials/odto-web-pty-server:latest` | debian:bookworm  | ~80 MB  | PTY WebSocket Server (Rust)      |
| `oddessentials/odto-web-ui:latest`         | nginx:alpine     | ~25 MB  | Web Terminal Frontend (nginx)    |

#### Usage

```bash
# Pull latest images
docker pull oddessentials/odto-gateway:latest
docker pull oddessentials/odto-processor:latest
docker pull oddessentials/odto-metrics-engine:latest
docker pull oddessentials/odto-read-model:latest
docker pull oddessentials/odto-web-pty-server:latest
docker pull oddessentials/odto-web-ui:latest

# Run integration tests with pre-built images
docker compose -f docker-compose.integration.yml up -d
```

#### Image Tagging

- `:latest` — Current `main` branch build
- `:sha-<commit>` — Exact commit traceability

#### CI Integration

Images are automatically built and pushed on every merge to `main`:

- Security: Build/push only runs on `main`, never on PRs or forks
- Contracts are baked into Gateway and Processor images for self-contained tests
- Core services use these pre-built images for <90s runtime (I4 invariant)

> **Note:** Visual regression tests (`tests/visual/`) build `web-pty-server` locally with `target: real` to embed the actual TUI binary. This ensures PR changes to the TUI are tested before merge.

## 🛑 Cleanup

**Via TUI (recommended):**
Press **Ctrl+Q** in the dashboard to cleanly stop port-forwards and delete the cluster.

**Manual cleanup:**

```bash
# Stop port-forwards (Windows PowerShell)
Get-Job | Stop-Job | Remove-Job

# Stop port-forwards (macOS/Linux - if running in background)
pkill -f "kubectl port-forward"

# Delete cluster (all platforms)
kind delete cluster --name task-observatory
```
